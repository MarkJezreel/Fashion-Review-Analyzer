This is the worst store I have ever shopped at. My order is a month late and customer service keeps ignoring my emails.,negative
"The quality is absolutely terrible. The 'sweater' is a thin, scratchy piece of polyester that looks nothing like the photo. Complete scam.",negative
I received the wrong item and now they are telling me the item I actually ordered is out of stock. So frustrating! Never ordering again.,negative
Do not buy from here! The sizing is a joke. I ordered an 'L' and it fits like an 'XS'. I can't even get it on. What a waste of money.,negative
I tried to return an item that was clearly defective (it arrived with a hole!) and they are refusing to refund my money. This is theft.,negative
"The shipping cost is outrageous, and it still took three weeks to arrive. The box was crushed and the item inside was wrinkled beyond belief.",negative
"The color of the dress in person is a hideous, dull brown. The photo online showed a vibrant chestnut. This is false advertising.",negative
"After one single wash (following the instructions!), the shirt shrank two sizes and all the color bled out. It's completely unwearable.",negative
The 'leather' bag smells like toxic chemicals and plastic. It's clearly cheap pleather. I am so disappointed and feel totally ripped off.,negative
I'm still waiting for a refund for a return I sent back over a month ago. Their customer service just says 'it's processing.' Unacceptable.,negative
The button fell off my coat the second time I wore it. The stitching is coming undone everywhere. This is fast fashion at its worst.,negative
"This company floods my inbox with spam emails, but when I actually need help with an order, they are nowhere to be found. Terrible priorities.",negative
"The fit is so awkward. The waist is tiny but the hips are huge, and the material has zero stretch. It's designed for a mannequin, not a person.",negative
I paid extra for express shipping and my package still hasn't even been sent out a week later. I needed this for an event. So angry.,negative
The website is a buggy mess. It charged my card twice for one order and it took three days and a call to my bank to get it fixed.,negative
This store is way too overpriced for the quality you get. You can find the exact same items on other sites for half the price.,negative
"The material is so thin it's completely see-through. I can't wear this blouse anywhere without a tank top underneath, which ruins the look.",negative
I wish I had read the reviews before buying. This company is notorious for its terrible return policy. They make it impossible to get your money back.,negative
The 'final sale' policy is a scam. They put defective items on final sale so you can't return them. Avoid at all costs.,negative
My package arrived looking like it had been run over. The box was open and the delivery driver just left it in the rain. Horrible experience.,negative
"The pants I received had a broken zipper. How does that even get past quality control? Oh wait, they clearly don't have one.",negative
This store constantly has 'sales' that are just inflated original prices. Don't fall for their manipulative marketing tactics.,negative
The cut of this t-shirt is so boxy and unflattering. It looks like a potato sack on me. Definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it.,negative
"I ordered a set and only received the top. Customer service is arguing with me that the bottoms weren't included, even though the picture shows both.",negative
This brand is terrible for petite people. Everything is way too long and comically oversized. They need to get their sizing in order.,negative
The wool sweater is so itchy I can't even wear it for five minutes. It's unwearable. A complete waste of money.,negative
I tried to cancel my order 10 minutes after placing it and they said it was 'already processed' and couldn't be stopped. Now I have to pay to return it.,negative
The photos on the website are so air-brushed and pinned on the models. The clothes look nothing like that in real life. It's incredibly deceptive.,negative
I will never shop here again. They sent me a used item! It had deodorant stains on it. I am absolutely disgusted.,negative
The 'customer support' is just an automated bot that sends you in circles. It's impossible to speak to an actual human being.,negative
"The jeans have a horrible chemical smell that won't come out, even after multiple washes. I don't even want this in my house.",negative
"The jacket is falling apart. Seams are ripping, the lining is torn, and I've only had it for a few weeks. Don't waste your money on this garbage.",negative
"Their inventory system is a joke. I ordered something, got a confirmation email, and then a week later they tell me it's been out of stock for months.",negative
This store charges a 'restocking fee' for returns. What a greedy and anti-consumer practice. I will be taking my business elsewhere.,negative
"The shoes gave me horrible blisters after just one short walk. They are stiff, poorly designed, and made from cheap, unforgiving material.",negative
"The online size guide is completely wrong. I measured myself and ordered based on their chart, and the item is at least two sizes too big.",negative
I bought a 'silk' dress and the tag says 100% polyester. This is illegal and completely fraudulent. I am reporting them.,negative
"This store is a massive disappointment. I used to love shopping here, but the quality has fallen off a cliff while the prices have skyrocketed.",negative
My order was stolen and the company refuses to help. They just told me to file a police report. They have zero accountability.,negative
The seams on this shirt are so crooked and uneven. It looks like it was made in a hurry by someone who has never sewn before. Just awful.,negative
The fabric feels like sandpaper on my skin. It's the most uncomfortable thing I've ever worn.,negative
They sent me two left shoes. How does that even happen?,negative
The zipper broke the first time I tried to put the dress on. Absolute garbage quality.,negative
Their tracking number didn't even work. I had no idea where my package was for weeks.,negative
This company deletes negative reviews on their website. So dishonest.,negative
The shirt came with makeup stains on the collar. Clearly a return they resold without checking.,negative
"Every time I contact support, they just copy-paste the same response. It's infuriating.",negative
The sweater arrived with a weird oily stain on the sleeve. Totally ruined.,negative
The dress was so wrinkled it looked like it had been shoved in a ball for months.,negative
The sizing is inconsistent across every product. Nothing fits the same.,negative
The fabric is so cheap that threads started coming loose as soon as I tried it on.,negative
They double charged me and took weeks to refund the extra amount.,negative
The jacket has loose threads everywhere and feels like it's going to fall apart.,negative
They sent me the wrong size and then refused to cover the return shipping.,negative
The color faded dramatically after just one wash. It looks like I've owned it for years already.,negative
Their app crashed multiple times during checkout and charged me twice.,negative
The shoes squeak so loudly when I walk that it's embarrassing.,negative
The skirt I received had a big tear right in the middle seam. How did this pass inspection?,negative
I got a shirt with one sleeve longer than the other. It's laughably bad.,negative
The print started peeling off after the first wash. Total waste of money.,negative
Their return process is so complicated it feels like they're trying to make you give up.,negative
My order was split into three shipments without warning and arrived weeks apart.,negative
They refused to price match even though I showed them their own sale price.,negative
The fabric has a horrible chemical smell that gave me a headache.,negative
The tag says 'hand wash only' but their website said machine washable. Misinformation everywhere.,negative
I received someone else's order entirely. None of the items were mine.,negative
The package came without any protection. Everything inside was damaged.,negative
The sizing chart must be a joke. Nothing I ordered fits even remotely right.,negative
They charged me for expedited shipping but sent it standard anyway.,negative
Customer service hung up on me when I asked for a refund.,negative
The top started unraveling at the seams the second time I wore it.,negative
Their advertised 'free returns' comes with hidden fees. Total scam.,negative
The hoodie I bought started pilling after just one wear.,negative
They keep changing the delivery date every time I check. It's never accurate.,negative
The jeans stretched out so much after one wear they look baggy and sloppy now.,negative
I emailed them five times and never got a single response.,negative
The clothes look completely different in person than on their website. Total bait and switch.,negative
The belt snapped while I was wearing it. Embarrassing and cheap.,negative
The lining of the coat isn't even sewn in properly. It bunches up horribly.,negative
Their packaging smelled like mildew when it arrived. Gross.,negative
They lost my return package and are refusing to give me a refund.,negative
The material is so flimsy I'm afraid it will rip every time I move.,negative
The shoes fell apart after just one week of use. Glue everywhere.,negative
The dress is completely see-through despite being labeled 'lined'.,negative
They overcharged me on shipping and won't correct the mistake.,negative
The product photos must be heavily edited because what I got is unrecognizable.,negative
They sent me a pair of pants with one leg shorter than the other.,negative
The elastic waistband on these pants snapped after one wear.,negative
I ordered black jeans and received bright blue ones. Total incompetence.,negative
The customer support number just leads to a voicemail box that’s always full.,negative
The sweater came with a strong perfume smell like someone wore it before.,negative
The stitching on the pockets ripped open the first time I used them.,negative
"I waited over a month for my order, and it still arrived incomplete.",negative
This brand is not worth the hype. Everything about my experience was disappointing.,negative
Their system charged me for an item that was out of stock and they never refunded me until I filed a dispute.,negative
The shirt shrank unevenly after washing. One sleeve is now shorter than the other.,negative
Their sizing is so off I honestly think they just guess at the measurements.,negative
This was my first order and it will definitely be my last.,negative
"The shirt came with loose threads everywhere, like it was never finished properly.",negative
Their email support promised a solution but then completely ghosted me. I had to dispute the charge with my bank.,negative
Very disappointed. The item I received doesn’t look like the photo at all. The fabric is thin and see-through.,negative
Not happy with my purchase. Wrong size delivered even though I double-checked the chart.,negative
The stitching came undone after just one wash. Poor quality for the price.,negative
"Color is totally different from the one in the picture. I ordered beige, but it looks more like gray.",negative
Item arrived late and packaging was damaged. The shirt even had a small tear.,negative
Too small! I ordered large but it fits like a small. Not true to size at all.,negative
Material feels cheap and itchy on the skin. Definitely not what I expected.,negative
Terrible experience. The seller didn’t respond to my messages when I asked for an exchange.,negative
"Fabric is rough and uncomfortable. Also, it shrank after washing.",negative
Do not buy! It looks nothing like the pictures — very poor quality. I regret this purchase.,negative
The color faded after just one wash. I’m so disappointed with this product.,negative
I received the wrong item and the seller didn’t offer any proper solution.,negative
Buttons fell off on the first use. Clearly not made with care.,negative
Arrived with stains on it. Quality control is terrible.,negative
The size chart is inaccurate. I followed the guide but it still didn’t fit.,negative
Threads were sticking out everywhere. Looks cheap and poorly made.,negative
I waited two weeks for this and it’s not worth it at all.,negative
"Photo looked classy, but the actual item is totally different. Waste of money.",negative
Customer service was unhelpful when I requested a refund.,negative
Feels very low quality and uncomfortable. Would not recommend to anyone.,negative
"Sizing is All Over the Place. Bought three items in my usual size, and none of them fit. One was huge, one was too small.",negative
"Poor Quality Fabric. The shirt I ordered looked cute online, but in person, the fabric is cheap, thin, and see-through.",negative
Rude Staff. The sales assistant rolled her eyes when I asked to try on a second size. I felt like I was bothering her.,negative
Nightmare Return Process. Tried to return an unworn item with tags. They charged a 'restocking fee' plus I had to pay for return shipping.,negative
Clothes Look Nothing Like the Photos. The color was completely different—more of a dull gray than the vibrant blue shown online.,negative
"Everything is for 20-Somethings. As a woman in her 40s, I found nothing in this store that was age-appropriate.",negative
Fell Apart After One Wear. The seam on the dress ripped the first time I wore it out to dinner. Embarrassing and disappointing.,negative
"Extremely Slow Shipping. It took over three weeks for my order to arrive, with no communication about the delay.",negative
"Messy and Disorganized Store. The store was a mess. Clothes were falling off hangers, fitting rooms were full of discarded items.",negative
"Constantly Out of Stock. Every time I find something I like online, it's out of stock in my size. They never seem to restock popular items.",negative
"Uncomfortable Materials. The fabric on this dress was so scratchy and irritating, I couldn't wear it for more than an hour.",negative
Misleading Product Descriptions. The item was listed as 'wool blend' but it was less than 5% wool. Felt completely synthetic.,negative
Aggressive Sales Tactics. The staff wouldn't leave me alone to browse. They were pushing sales from the moment I walked in.,negative
Damaged Item Received. The jacket arrived with a noticeable pull in the fabric and a broken zipper. Quality control is non-existent.,negative
"No Fitting Rooms. Due to 'company policy,' the fitting rooms were closed. How am I supposed to know if anything fits?",negative
Overpriced for the Quality. This is fast fashion quality with a luxury price tag. I feel completely ripped off.,negative
Horrible Odor on Clothes. The items I received smelled strongly of cheap perfume and chemicals. I had to wash them three times.,negative
Excessive Packaging. My single t-shirt arrived in a huge box filled with non-recyclable plastic. So wasteful.,negative
Automatic Newsletter Sign-Up. I was automatically signed up for a daily newsletter without my consent. Very spammy.,negative
"Inconsistent Items. I bought the same shirt in two different colors, and they fit completely differently. Zero consistency.",negative
"Cheap, Scratchy Zippers. The zippers on their jeans and dresses feel like they'll break any second. So poorly made.",negative
No Customer Service Response. I've emailed three times about a missing item from my order and have received no reply.,negative
"Items Marked 'Final Sale' That Shouldn't Be. Basic, non-sale items were marked as final sale, making returns impossible.",negative
Pilling After First Wash. My new sweater was covered in pills after one gentle cycle in the washing machine.,negative
Wrong Item Shipped. I ordered a dress and received a completely different top. Now I have to deal with the hassle of a return.,negative
Stains on New Clothing. The brand new white blouse had a faint yellow stain on the collar. Disgusting.,negative
Website Crashed During Checkout. Lost the items in my cart during a flash sale because the site couldn't handle the traffic.,negative
"Limited Payment Options. They didn't accept my preferred payment method, which was a major inconvenience.",negative
Clothes Are Unflattering Cuts. The proportions on their dresses are just strange. Nothing hung right on my body.,negative
Store was Overheated. The temperature in the store was so hot and stuffy it was unbearable to try on clothes.,negative
Terrible quality. The sweater I bought pilled after just one wear.,negative
The staff was so rude. I asked for help and was completely ignored.,negative
Way too overpriced for what you get. The materials feel cheap.,negative
The store was a complete mess. Clothes were all over the floor and racks were disorganized.,negative
Horrible selection. Everything looked dated and uninspired.,negative
I could not find my size in *anything*. It seems like they only cater to one body type.,negative
Their return policy is a nightmare. They make it impossible to get your money back.,negative
Longest checkout line ever. They only had one cashier working during a rush.,negative
"A sales associate was so pushy, trying to get me to buy things I didn't even like.",negative
The lighting in the fitting rooms is awful. You can't tell what anything actually looks like.,negative
"The item rang up for a different price than what was on the tag, and they wouldn't honor it.",negative
I washed a shirt exactly as the label said and it shrank two sizes.,negative
The music was painfully loud. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.,negative
The store smelled strange and felt dirty.,negative
I placed an online order for pickup and they canceled it without explanation.,negative
"There's just nothing special here. It's the same stuff you see everywhere else, but more expensive.",negative
The seams on the pants I bought started unraveling after two weeks.,negative
No one was available to open a fitting room for me. I waited 10 minutes and then left.,negative
The layout is really confusing and cramped.,negative
I wouldn't waste your time or money here. Go somewhere else.,negative
The fabric is too thin and see-through.,negative
Doesn’t look like the picture at all.,negative
Very disappointed — wrong size sent.,negative
The stitching came loose after one wash.,negative

The sizing chart is inaccurate.,negative
The cloth smells weird even after washing.,negative
Seller didn’t respond to my messages.,negative
Not worth the money.,negative

I regret buying this.,negative
Very low-quality material — feels like paper.,negative
Zipper broke after a few uses.,negative
"The label says one size, but it’s too small.",negative
Will not order from this shop again.,negative
"The dress is nice, but the color is much darker than the picture. I was expecting a light beige, but it's more of a tan. I'll still keep it.",neutral
"The quality of the t-shirt is okay for the price. Not amazing, but not bad either. It's a decent basic for everyday wear.",neutral
"Shipping took a lot longer than I expected, almost three weeks. The item itself is fine, but I won't order again if I need something quickly.",neutral
"I had to return the pants because the fit was weird on me, but the return process was fairly easy. So, a mixed experience.",neutral
"The sweater is very soft, but it's also very thin. I'll have to wear something underneath it, which I wasn't planning on. It's just okay.",neutral
"I bought this on final sale, so I can't return it. It's a little tighter than I'd like, but the quality seems good. I just wish the sizing was more consistent.",neutral
"The item is as described. Nothing special, but it serves its purpose. It's a plain black skirt, hard to get wrong.",neutral
"I like the style of the jacket, but the zipper gets stuck constantly. It's annoying, but not a deal-breaker for me. I'll probably keep it.",neutral
"Customer service responded, but it took them four days to get back to my initial email. They did solve my problem, but the wait was not ideal.",neutral
"The material is a bit scratchier than I expected, but it looks nice on. I'm hoping it will soften up after a few washes.",neutral
"I have to pay for my own return shipping, which is a bummer. The shirt just didn't look right on me. The quality was fine, though.",neutral
"The shirt is fine. It's not something I'm excited about, but I'll wear it. It just looks a bit average. Fit is true to size.",neutral
"The pants are very comfortable, but they are also very long. I'm 5'5 and I'll definitely need to get them hemmed. A bit of an extra hassle.",neutral
"I ordered three items, and two of them are great. The third one, a blouse, has a very strange fit and I'll be returning it. So, 2 out of 3 isn't bad.",neutral
The package arrived on time and the item is as described. It just didn't wow me. It's an average product from an average store.,neutral
"The shoes are very stylish, but they aren't very comfortable. I can only wear them for a couple of hours. Good for an event, but not for all-day wear.",neutral
"The price was a bit high for what it is. It's a nice top, but I'm not sure it's worth $80. I'm on the fence about keeping it.",neutral
"The color was beautiful, but the material wrinkles if you just look at it. It's going to be very high-maintenance to keep it looking nice.",neutral
"I like the shirt, but it is hand-wash only, which I didn’t realise when I bought it. That's a bit inconvenient for a casual top.",neutral
"The fit is a bit boxy. I was hoping for something more fitted, but it's comfortable. I'll probably just wear it around the house.",neutral
"The 'white' t-shirt is definitely more of an off-white or cream color. It's fine, but it doesn't match the pure white sneakers I bought it for.",neutral
It's an okay dress. The fabric is a standard cotton-poly blend. It fits true to size. I have no strong feelings about it one way or the other.,neutral
"I got this on sale, and I'm glad I didn’t pay full price. The quality is just okay. It’s worth the sale price, but not a penny more.",neutral
"The pattern on the skirt is nice, but the elastic waistband feels a bit cheap. It's comfortable, but I wonder how long it will last.",neutral
"I'm not sure how I feel about this. The style is very trendy, so I worry it will look dated by next year. The quality is decent, though.",neutral
"It's fine. The order came, it was correct, the item fits. I just don't love it. It's a bit boring. But nothing is wrong with it.",neutral
"The sleeves on the sweater are a bit shorter than I'd like, they hit above my wrist bone. Otherwise, it's a nice, warm sweater.",neutral
"The buttons on the cardigan feel a bit loose, like they might fall off. The knit itself is soft. I might just reinforce the buttons myself.",neutral
"The website photos are a bit misleading. The top looked more structured online, but it's actually very flowy. It's not bad, just different from my expectation.",neutral
"This is my second time ordering. The first time was great, but this time shipping was very slow. The product itself is good, so I'm neutral.",neutral
"The pockets on these jeans are tiny. My phone doesn't fit. It's a common problem, but still annoying. The jeans themselves fit well.",neutral
"The material is 100% cotton, which is great, but it's also very stiff. I'm hoping it breaks in over time. For now, it's just okay.",neutral
"The website was a little hard to navigate, but I eventually found what I wanted. The checkout process was smooth. The item is fine.",neutral
"I like the dress, but I had to size up. The size chart seems to be off. Now that I have the right size, it's good.",neutral
"It's an average piece of clothing. It didn't shrink in the wash, which is a plus. It's not my favourite, but it's a useful item to have.",neutral
"The design is cute, but the fabric is thinner than I thought it would be. It will be okay for spring, but it's not warm enough for fall.",neutral
"I had a question for customer service and they used a generic, copy-pasted response. It answered my question, but it felt very impersonal.",neutral
"The shorts are a good length and the fit is okay. The 'dark wash' denim is much lighter than it appeared online. Not quite what I wanted, but fine.",neutral
"I bought a final sale item. It fits, and the quality is acceptable. I'm not thrilled with it, but for the price, I can't really complain.",neutral
"The belt is fine. The 'leather' is obviously fake, but it looks decent enough from a distance. You get what you pay for.",neutral
"The sandals are comfortable, but the straps are a bit loose. I might have to punch an extra hole to make them fit better.",neutral
"The hoodie is a good basic, but it's not as soft as I hoped. It's fine for casual wear.",neutral
"The skirt fits well, but the waistband rolls down sometimes. Not a dealbreaker, just slightly annoying.",neutral
"The pattern is unique, but the fabric feels a bit cheap. I’ll still wear it occasionally.",neutral
"The hat I ordered arrived slightly squished, but it reshaped after a while. Not a big issue.",neutral
"The tote bag is sturdy, but the straps are shorter than I expected. It's okay for light use.",neutral
"The coat is warm, but the buttons feel flimsy. I’ll probably reinforce them myself.",neutral
"The socks are fine. Nothing special, but they do the job.",neutral
"I ordered a scarf and it's exactly like the photo. It's not super soft, but it's decent quality.",neutral
"The jumpsuit fits well overall, but it's a bit tricky to get on and off. Something to keep in mind.",neutral
"The color of the jacket is nice, but it's not as bright as the website showed. Still wearable.",neutral
"The shirt looks good but feels average. I don’t love it, but I don’t hate it either.",neutral
"The jeans are okay, but the zipper feels a little cheap. Hopefully it lasts.",neutral
"The cardigan has a nice design, but the fabric pills a bit after the first wash.",neutral
"The dress fits fine, but the length is awkward on me. I might alter it.",neutral
"The bag is functional, but it’s smaller than expected. I’ll still use it for short trips.",neutral
The blouse is nice but a bit see-through. I’ll need to wear a camisole underneath.,neutral
"The beanie is warm, but it sheds a bit of lint. It's alright for winter.",neutral
"The blazer fits well, but it came a little wrinkled. A quick steam fixed it.",neutral
The fabric on the pants feels a bit stiff out of the package. Hopefully it softens after washing.,neutral
"The neckline is a little higher than I prefer, but the shirt still looks fine.",neutral
The gloves are okay quality. They work but aren't particularly warm.,neutral
"The boots are stylish, but the soles are slippery. I’ll add grip pads.",neutral
"The pajamas are comfy, but the print faded a bit after one wash.",neutral
The sweater fits nicely but the sleeves are slightly itchy. I can wear a layer underneath.,neutral
"The dress is fine, but it’s not as flattering on me as I hoped.",neutral
"The color of the blouse is different under natural light, but still pretty.",neutral
"The socks are slightly thin, but they’ll work for layering.",neutral
"The jacket is decent for the price, but the lining isn’t very thick.",neutral
The tank top is a bit sheer but perfect for layering.,neutral
The shirt is okay but wrinkles easily. I’ll just iron it more often.,neutral
"The material feels average, not super soft but not rough either.",neutral
"The shoes fit, but they’re a bit stiff at the heel. They might break in over time.",neutral
"The pants have a nice cut, but the fabric attracts lint. I’ll need to use a roller often.",neutral
"The coat is good overall, but the pockets are shallow.",neutral
The beanie fits well but is a bit tight at the band. It should stretch out with wear.,neutral
"The t-shirt is exactly as expected. Nothing more, nothing less.",neutral
"The necklace looks nice, but the clasp is a little fiddly.",neutral
"The skirt drapes well, but it wrinkles easily when sitting.",neutral
"The hoodie is fine, but the drawstrings are uneven lengths. Minor issue.",neutral
"The shorts are comfy, but they ride up slightly when walking.",neutral
"The sweater is okay, but the shade is slightly different from what I pictured.",neutral
"The dress is cute, but the belt it came with feels cheap.",neutral

The scarf is soft but sheds a little bit of fuzz.,neutral
"The pants are practical, but the fabric makes a swishing noise when walking.",neutral
"The socks are okay. Not thick, not thin. Just standard.",neutral
"The gloves fit, but the touchscreen tips are only somewhat accurate.",neutral
"The belt buckle feels a bit light, but it functions fine.",neutral
"The hoodie is comfy, but the pocket is slightly uneven. Not a big deal.",neutral
The sweater is decent but the neckline is a bit looser than I prefer.,neutral
The dress fits well but the straps are a little long. I might adjust them.,neutral
"The t-shirt is okay, but the print looks slightly faded compared to the picture.",neutral
"The packaging was simple and nothing special. The item inside was fine, though.",neutral
"The hoodie fits well, but the drawstrings are uneven. Not a big deal, just a little sloppy.",neutral
"I like the pattern, but the fabric is a bit stiffer than I expected. It might soften after washing.",neutral
It’s okay. Not the best quality but still wearable. You get what you pay for.,neutral

The fit is fine but the material feels a bit different from what I expected.,neutral

"Hit or Miss. I've ordered from here a few times. Some items have been great, others have been duds. You have to be selective.",neutral
"Prices are a Bit High. The quality is decent, but I'm not sure it fully justifies the price point. I'd be more likely to shop here on sale.",neutral
"Standard Shopping Experience. There's nothing particularly wrong with this shop, but there's nothing that makes it stand out either.",neutral
"Sizing Ran a Little Small. The dress I ordered was nice, but I should have sized up. The material has no stretch.",neutral
"Nice Designs, Average Execution. I really like the aesthetic of this brand. However, the actual construction of the garments feels just average.",neutral
"Fast Shipping, Average Product. I was impressed with how quickly my order arrived. The item itself was just as I expected—nothing amazing.",neutral
Fine for a One-Time Purchase. I bought a coat here for a specific trip. It kept me warm and looked fine. I probably won't become a regular.,neutral
In-Store and Online Differ. The store has a limited selection compared to the website. The experience was neutral.,neutral
"Does the Job. I needed a basic black blazer and this one works. It's not remarkable in any way, but it serves its purpose.",neutral
"Average Quality. For the price, I expected a bit better stitching and fabric. It's acceptable, but I've had better from other brands.",neutral
